# MML-estimation-database-normalisation
This repository contains code I used for a university paper that extended the work of "Database normalization as a by-product of minimum message length inference" by Dowe and Zaidi (2010)  
  
My paper can be accessed from: http://bhavikm.org/pdfs/Report-MML-Bhavik-Maneck-FIT4009.pdf  

The basic idea is to generate data for a contrived example of database normalisation (from 1st Nornal Form through to 5th Normal Form) and produce Minimum Message Length (MML) estimates of the structure and data in each normal form. Dowe and Zaidi showed MML estimates up to 3rd Normal Form, my paper and code extended this to Boyce-Codd Normal Form, 4th Normal Form  and 5th Normal Form.
